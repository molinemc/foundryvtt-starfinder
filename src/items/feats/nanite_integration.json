      "value": "<p>Nanites responsible for maintaining your constructed body have been upgraded, and a subset of them has been reprogrammed to perform incredible feats.<br><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Character level 3rd, constructed racial trait or construct type.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Benefit</strong>: Your body has integrated technology that provides you with one of the following benefits, chosen when you gain the feat. Once chosen, the benefit cannot be changed.<br><em>Rebooting Nanites:</em> Whenever you fail a saving throw against an effect that causes you to gain the asleep, blinded, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, stunned, or unconscious condition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to attempt a new saving throw against the effect at the same DC. If you succeed, the condition ends, though you still suffer any other effects of the original failed saving throw.<br><em>Repairing Nanites:</em> Whenever you take Hit Point damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to gain fast healing equal to one-quarter your character level (minimum fast healing 1) for 1 minute.<br><em>Surging Nanites:</em> Before you attempt a skill or ability check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to gain a +2 racial bonus to that check.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Special</strong>: You can select this feat up to three times. Each time, you must select a different benefit.</span></p>",
