You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack, and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn. If you have the trick attack class feature, you can take your movement from trick attack at any time during a trick attack with a melee weapon (instead of only before), without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Normal</strong>: You can move only before or after an attack, not both.</span></p>",
