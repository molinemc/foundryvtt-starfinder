While your arms are extended, you take a âˆ’2 penalty to attack rolls with weapons wielded in your hands and to Dexterity- and Strength-based ability checks and skill checks. You can use this ability to grab an object or surface and pull yourself to that item or surface as a full action, or you can anchor yourself where you are to lower yourself to another surface. When doing so, you move 15 feet as if using a fly speed with perfect maneuverability, ending your movement in a square adjacent to the chosen object or surface. If your movement does not end on solid ground, you either fall or must begin climbing the surface you grabbed (your choice).</span></p>",
