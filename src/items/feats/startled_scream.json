      "value": "<p>When something bad is about to go down, you scream to let everyone know.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Benefit</strong>: Before initiative is rolled during an encounter, you can scream as part of <a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Other%20Actions&amp;Category=Actions%20in%20Combat\">combat banter</a> even if you’re surprised. If you do, allies who are surprised but can hear you don’t gain the flat-footed condition, while allies who aren’t surprised gain a +1 insight bonus to initiative checks. You gain the appropriate benefit depending on whether you are surprised or not. However, your scream is loud, possibly drawing the attention of foes that can hear you and alerting others within earshot. You’re also shaken until the end of your next turn.</span></p>",
