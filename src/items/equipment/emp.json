When this effect triggers, the target&rsquo;s worn and wielded technology, including weapons without the analog special property, armor environmental protections, powered armor, and technological and hybrid items, cease functioning for 1 round. A technological construct struck by this effect must succeed at a Reflex save or be staggered for 1 round. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon&rsquo;s normal critical hit effect or the EMP effect.&nbsp;</span></p>",
