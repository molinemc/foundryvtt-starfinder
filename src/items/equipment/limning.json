      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">Successful attacks with a weapon with the <em>limning</em> fusion surround the target with a glowing aura. For 1 round after you successfully attack a single creature with your weapon, it is surrounded by a pale glow that reveals its location. While so illuminated, the creature takes a –20 penalty to Stealth checks and does not benefit from concealment provided by darkness, <em>invisibility</em>, smoke, and similar effects. However, <em>displacement</em> and other effects that shift location entirely are not negated. The light is too dim to harm creatures vulnerable to light and does not serve to illuminate anything but the creature affected by limning. <em>Limning</em> weapons create glows in a variety of hues, and some even bestow a variety of colors. The <em>limning</em> fusion has no effect on attacks that affect multiple foes. MALEDICTION LEVEL 9 Once per day when you successfully attack a foe with a weapon with the <em>malediction</em> fusion, as a reaction you can cast <em>bestow curse</em> on the target as a spell-like ability (using the weapon’s item level as the caster level). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the weapon with this fusion has an item level of 14 or higher you may use this ability twice per day, and if it has an item level of 19 or higher you may use this ability three times per day. A weapon cannot have the <em>malediction</em> fusion if it also has either the <em>holy</em> or <em>merciful</em> weapon fusions.&nbsp;</span></p>",
