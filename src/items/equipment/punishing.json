When you damage a creature with the weapon, you receive a +1 bonus to damage against that target with this weapon until the end of your turn. If you successfully damage the same creature with this weapon multiple times in the same round, the bonus increases by 1 on each additional attack. If you damage a creature with this weapon when it isnâ€™t your turn, such as with an attack of opportunity, the bonus lasts until the end of your next turn after the attack.&nbsp;</span></p>",
