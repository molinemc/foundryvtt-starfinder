Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with acid damage. You can activate or deactivate the <em>corrosive </em>fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with acid (you decide which damage type is replaced each time you activate the <em>corrosive </em>fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal acid damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.&nbsp;</span></p>",
