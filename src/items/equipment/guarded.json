When you make a ranged attack using a weapon with this fusion, your attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The <em>guarded</em> fusion does not prevent attacks of opportunity provoked for any reason other than making a ranged attack. Only ranged and thrown weapons can benefit from this fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>",
