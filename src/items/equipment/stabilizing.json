While wielding such a weapon, you can steady yourself even if you donâ€™t have a surface to grab onto or a means of propulsion. If you do have such means, you can steady yourself as either a move action or a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus to checks to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. Only melee weapons, small arms, and long arms can benefit from the <em>stabilizing</em> fusion.&nbsp;</em></span></p>",
