The fusion’s benefits can be granted against only one target at a time. Once the weapon hits a new target, it resets and starts building up momentum against that target, losing the benefits it might have had for any previous target. An adaptive weapon gains the following benefits depending on how many hits it has scored against a given target. The effects are cumulative.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>3+ Hits:</strong> The weapon ignores an amount of the target’s energy resistance or damage resistance equal to half the weapon’s item level.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>5+ Hits:</strong> The weapon gains an enhancement bonus to damage equal to half the item level.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>7+ Hits:</strong> The target is flat-footed against attacks made with this weapon.</span></p>",
