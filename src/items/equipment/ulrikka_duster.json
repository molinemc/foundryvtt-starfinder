Attacks made with weapons with this fusion ignore half of a target itemâ€™s hardness. Use of such weapons has helped more than one short-supplied dwarven mining crew remove the last bits of useful material from an asteroid while still remaining armed enough to fight off space pirates.&nbsp;</span></p>",
