      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">The <em>ensnaring</em> fusion binds the target on a critical hit. On a critical hit with this weapon, you can apply the entangle weapon special property. The entangle effect ends after 1 minute if the target has not already escaped it. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weaponâ€™s normal critical hit effect or the entangle effect. If you successfully affect a target with both the <em>entangling</em> and <em>ensnaring</em> fusions on the same attack roll, only the <em>ensnaring</em> fusion applies, and your use of the <em>entangling</em> fusion is not consumed. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.&nbsp;</span></p>",
