Such weapons typically take on decorations of crossed blades, bundles of arrows, or similar sets of weaponry. When you use a <em>tactical</em> weapon to provide covering fire or harrying fire, the bonus granted increases by 1. This ability of this fusion doesnâ€™t stack with other abilities that increase the bonuses provided by covering fire or harrying fire.&nbsp;</span></p>",
