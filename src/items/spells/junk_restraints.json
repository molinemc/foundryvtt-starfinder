      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You turn a pile of technological junk into fetters and shackles that restrain a creature within range. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.<br>While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with energy powerful enough to restrain a Large or smaller creature. The junk flies toward the creature and attaches itself to the creature’s limbs or otherwise ensnares it, causing it to gain the entangled condition for the duration of the spell or until it ends the condition by succeeding at an Acrobatics check to escape as a move action. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × your caster level.<br>If the targeted creature succeeds at a Reflex save, the junk lands adjacent to them harmlessly.</p>",
