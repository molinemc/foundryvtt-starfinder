      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You pluck details from alternate-reality versions of targets to weave parallel forms, making the targets appear and act differently. You affect the targets as if they were each under a&nbsp;disguise self&nbsp;spell, deciding the details when you cast this spell. In addition,&nbsp;parallel form&nbsp;provides the mannerisms of the chosen form, and the tactile and audible properties of the target’s equipment can seem different, although all the target’s gear must appear to be of the same sort (for example, a melee weapon can appear to be only another sort of melee weapon). If you cast this spell to make the target appear to be a specific individual, the target gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Bluff checks to claim to be that individual. A creature that interacts with the target and succeeds at a Will saving throw recognizes the parallel form as an illusion.</p>",
