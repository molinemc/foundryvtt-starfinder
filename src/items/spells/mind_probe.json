      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You gain access to the target’s memories and knowledge, and you can pry the information you want from them involuntarily.<br><br>You can attempt to learn the answer to one question of your choice per round; after each question, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to end the spell. If it fails, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it answers however it chooses and you believe that wrong answer to be the truth. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly into your mind. You and the target don’t need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate sensory images in answer to your questions.</p>",
