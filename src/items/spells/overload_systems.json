      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By touching the target (usually requiring a melee attack roll against the target’s EAC, but you can add your key ability score modifier instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher), you flood the target’s body with random jolts of electricity or other interference. On a failed Fortitude save, the target is overwhelmed and potentially unable to perform tasks as normal. While this spell is in effect, whenever the target takes any action or reaction, there is a 50% chance that the target simply takes no action instead. Roll this chance separately for each action the target would take. For example, if the target wishes to move and attack during its turn, it would roll d% twice to determine whether it could take those actions—once before each action it wishes to take. Each attack of a full attack action counts as separate action.<br><br>This spell is effective against living and unliving creatures, and casting it doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>",
