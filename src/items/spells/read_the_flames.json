      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While casting this spell, you must focus on a semi-controlled flame (such as one produced by a lighter or a weapon with the flaming weapon fusion), centering your mind and analyzing the blaze’s movements for subtle patterns that describe the underlying fundamentals of the universe. Once during the spell’s duration, you can center yourself as a standard action (this is a purely mental action) to remember your time spent scrutinizing the flame, choosing one of the benefits below. When the chosen effect ends, so does the spell.<br><strong>Mental Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;At some point during the next 10 minutes, you can reroll one skill check with a +4 circumstance bonus.<br><strong>Physical Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to EAC and KAC until the end of your next turn.<br><strong>Spiritual Clarity:</strong>&nbsp;You can immediately attempt a new saving throw against any mind-affecting effect currently affecting you.</p>",
