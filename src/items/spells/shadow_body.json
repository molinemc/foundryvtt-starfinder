      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You transform the matter of your body and any objects you carry or wear into the essence of the Shadow Plane. You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness (reduced to concealment against creatures that have darkvision). Your body and gear are incorporeal, but you can’t fly or pass through solid objects or creatures, and your gear can’t be removed from you or used by anyone. You can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical surfaces and liquids, and difficult terrain doesn’t slow you. However, you can’t attack physically or manipulate objects. You can speak, cast spells that require no items to cast, and perform mental actions. If you can use spells that have a range of touch and such a spell requires an attack roll, you target EAC. If you lose consciousness, you and your gear return to your natural form.</p>",
