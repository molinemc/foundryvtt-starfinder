      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You conjure several Drift beacons into your current star system. The beacons appear orbiting the star or stars at various distances but are not in danger of colliding with any other celestial bodies. For the duration of the spell, the system takes 2d6 fewer days to reach for the purposes of Drift travel to that system, to a minimum of 1 day. This reduction is factored in before dividing the result by a Drift engineâ€™s rating, and a system can benefit from only one casting of this spell at a time. The beacons return to where they came from when the spell ends.<br>This spell has no effect if cast while not in a star system or while within the Drift, and it does not reduce the time it takes to travel to Absalom Station.</p>",
