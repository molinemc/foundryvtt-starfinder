      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell functions as the&nbsp;handy junkbot&nbsp;spell, but instead creates a stealthy drone that can investigate and spy, transmitting what it sees back to you. A prowling junkbot is Tiny, its EAC and KAC are each equal to 12 + your caster level, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to one tenth of your own (but no Stamina Points). It has a land speed and a climb speed of 30 feet. It can accomplish all tasks described in the Computers, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills, as well as the disable device task of Engineering, is considered trained in those skills, and has a total skill bonus in each equal to 3 + your caster level. A prowling junkbot is treated as if it were using a hackerâ€™s kit when using the Computers skill and an engineering kit when using the Engineering skill. A prowling junkbot has low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and it telepathically transmits everything it sees and hears to you or a computer terminal you touch as part of the original casting of the spell. Images and sound transmitted to a terminal can be recorded.</p>",
