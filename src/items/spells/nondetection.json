      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as&nbsp;clairaudience/clairvoyance&nbsp;and spells with the word “detect” in their names.&nbsp;Nondetection&nbsp;also prevents location by magic items such as&nbsp;crystal balls&nbsp;and technological items such as cameras and surveillance systems. Casting this spell places significant stress on you, and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point.<br><br>If a magic divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level. If surveillance is attempted with remote cameras or sensors, the viewer must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level to see the target. If you cast&nbsp;nondetection&nbsp;on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC for each these checks is equal to 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature,&nbsp;nondetection&nbsp;wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.<br><br>Nondetection&nbsp;protects the target only from discovery by items and remote sensors, not by creatures. A camera mounted to a wall and monitored from a security booth is subject to&nbsp;nondetection, but a camera in a creature (including constructs) is not.</p>",
