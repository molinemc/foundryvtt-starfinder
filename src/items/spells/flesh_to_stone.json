      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You fire a dull gray ray at your target, making a ranged attack against your targetâ€™s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit and the target fails its Fortitude save, the target, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the target (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it gives off no sign of life even upon close inspection. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.<br><br>If this spell is cast upon a stone creature that was once flesh, it reverses the petrification.</p>",
