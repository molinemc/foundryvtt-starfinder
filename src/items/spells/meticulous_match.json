      "value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You compare two similar items and know if they are identical to one another or not. The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical match, or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are from the same creature. They are categorical if they are from the same species. No match exists if the blood samples are from different species or if one sample is stage blood.<br>Alternatively, you can compare dissimilar items and know if they have a potential relationship. For instance, you can compare a creatureâ€™s tooth against a bite mark and know whether that creature could have caused the bite mark. This spell is fallible. An identical match can result from comparing items that are duplicates of one another. For instance, a knife might have an identical match with a stab wound if an identical knife was used to inflict the wound. Identical twins might have identical blood or tissues.</p>",
